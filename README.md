### Division of Labor
Due to the nature of this assignment much of the labor was completed in person with all members present for the first portions of the project. In order to learn and gain practice we met frequently and bouced ideas off of each other while trying our own approaches and meeting back to land on what we considered to be the best take. 

In each group meeting we all mapped out what we wanted to do and discussed how we wanted to divide everything up.
We all got to know each others machines and we worked together to get things implemented. Regarding parts 1-4; we
met and worked together to plan and decide how to implement ideas. For the rest of the project we began to branch
and focus on different areas with Keaun working on parsing functions, expanding paths and a lot of the serious core functionality, Marlan working on a lot of the i/o redirection, some of the built-ins and execution 
statements, and Hayden working on some expand functionality as well as piping and some execution.

All members rate all other members a 10/10 would group again.
